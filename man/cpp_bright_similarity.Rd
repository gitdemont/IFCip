\title{Images Bright Detail Similarity Measurement}
\arguments{
\item{img1}{a NumericMatrix, containing bright detail image values.}

\item{img2}{a NumericMatrix, containing bright detail image values.}

\item{msk}{a LogicalMatrix, containing mask.}
}
\value{
a double, the similarity.
}
\description{
This function is designed to score similarity between two bright detail images.
}
\details{
the bright detail similarity is the non-mean normalized version of the log transformed Pearson's Correlation Coefficient.
It is designed to compare the small bright image detail of two images within a masked region.\cr
